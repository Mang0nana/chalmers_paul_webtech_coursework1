		<h2>About the Caesar Cipher:</h2>
		The Caesar cipher was named after Julius Caesar, whom was said to have used the cipher to a 3 letter shift<br>
		to encrypt military messages to his generals. The following is a quote from Suetonius in the biography "Life of Julius Caesar".<br><br> <i>"If he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, that is, by so changing the order of the letters of the alphabet,<br> that not a word could be made out. If anyone wishes to decipher these, and get at their meaning, he must substitute the fourth <br>letter of the alphabet, namely D, for A, and so with the others."</i><br>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Caesars"><h3>Suetonius, Life of Julius Caesar</h3></a>
		<!-- Explaination of cipher -->
		<h2>How it Works:</h2>
		Plain:    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ<br>
		Cipher:   XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW<br>
		<br>Here we see the plain alphabet, underneath is the alphabet shifted 23 times to the right (or 3 times to the left)<br>
		With this, we can encrypt a message. If we wanted to encrypt the word "Hello" using this 23 letter shift we would find:
		<br>H = E
		<br>E = B
		<br>L = I
		<br>L = I
		<br>O = L
		<br>Therefore, our encrypted message would be "Ebiil"
