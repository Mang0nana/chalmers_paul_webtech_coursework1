		<h2>About the Diffie-Hellman Method:</h2>
		Diffie-Hellman is a method in which encryption keys are generated. Is is used in a scenarip where end-to-end encryption<br>
		is required, during the creation of the key no information is passed over, only numbers. It is currently unbreakable due<br>
		to the way the keys are generated which is explained below.
		<br><br>
		<h2>How it Works:</h2>
		The two parties come up with two prime numbers, typically will be very large primes (the bigger the prime, the more secure)<br>
		and these will be named G and N. Both parties then pick a secret number which can be anything, they keep this to themselves<br>
		and don't share it with anyone, these will be names X and Y respectively. They both then perform the calculations below:<br><br>
		<h2>Calculations:</h2>
		<!-- Explaination of cipher calculations -->
		Party A performs the calculation of G<sup>x</sup> mod N<br>
		Party B performs the calculation of G<sup>y</sup> mod N<br>
		<br>
		They then pass eachother the results of this calculation and do the following:<br>
		<br>
		Party A performs the calculation of (Party B's result)<sup>x</sup> mod N<br>
		Party B performs the calculation of (Party A's result)<sup>y</sup> mod N<br>
		<br>
		Party A's end result should equal Party B's end result<br>
		And this end result then becomes the encryption key.<br>
		<br>
		This calculation can be represented by the following:<br>
		(G<sup>x</sup> mod N)<sup>y</sup> mod N = G<sup>xy</sup> mod N<br>
		(G<sup>y</sup> mod N)<sup>x</sup> mod N = G<sup>yx</sup> mod N<br>
		<br>
		No matter what way the exponentiation is represented you will always get the same answer.
